Realtime android React Native chat app

\## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I have developed a fully functional Android chat application using React Native CLI. This project showcases my proficiency in React Native development, having invested significant time in learning and practicing the framework.

The application offers a seamless user experience, beginning with a splash screen that provides a brief introduction. Upon launch, the app determines whether the user has previously logged in. If so, it automatically restores their session. For new users or those logging in for the first time, the app directs them to the login screen.

User preferences, such as theme and text size, are preserved across sessions. During the initial login, the app collects essential user information (name, email, profile picture) to create a new database entry where chat-history and friends will be stored.

The application integrates with OneSignal to enable push notifications, ensuring users stay updated with real-time messages and events.

At the root of the project, you will find us-app-debug.apk which you can install on your android device (you will need to enable 3rd-party installation). Feel free to message me if you would like to chat, search for user "rohadtsajt" in the app.

The app was built using React Native CLI instead of Expo to enable in-app authentication without a browser redirect. For more details about the project, you can install the app and check the "About" section or access the content directly [here](https://github.com/AndrasE/usapp/blob/main/src/screens/AboutMore.js) .

\## Run ðŸš€ These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on a virtual or physical android device. Either install android studio and have a virtual machine and/or have a device where debugging through usb enabled. Start with cloning this repo on your local machine via cli or github-desktop: \`\`\`sh $ git clone https://github.com/AndrasE/usapp $ cd PROJECTNAME \`\`\` To install and set up the library, run: \`\`\`sh $ npm i \`\`\` Get SHA certificate fingerprint keys: \`\`\`sh $ cd android && ./gradlew signingReport \`\`\` Create a firebase android app with authentication and a real-time database. You may need to go to console.cloud.google.com to enable authentication. (firebase should auto-create it, but not 100% will happen): \`\`\`sh insert SHA keys above \`\`\`

[Add Firebase to your Android project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)

Create a free OneSingal account. Get onesignal-id and onesignal-barer from app/settings: \`\`\`sh look for OneSignal App ID & Rest API Key \`\`\` Add your own credentials: \`\`\`sh $ cd PROJECTNAME && touch .env setup and insert your own API keys \`\`\` Serving the app: \`\`\`sh $ npx react-native start \`\`\` For building your own version of the apk follow these steps:
