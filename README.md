## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

After investing some time in learning react-native, watching countless hours of tutorials, I managed to create this fully functional chat-app. Feel free to install it and try it out. At the root of the project, you will find us-app-debug.apk which you can install on your android device (you will need to enable 3rd-party installation).Â
